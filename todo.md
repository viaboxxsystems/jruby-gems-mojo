What's left to do
=================

Technical
---------

- use  `bundle package` instead of `bundle install --deployment` [see the Documentation on gembundler.com](http://gembundler.com/bundle_package.html)
- respect offline mode
- check binding to lifecycle (generate-resources): which configuration is really needed in teh simplest case?
- consider using namespaces (maybe we shoud call them "gemsets" bc they roughly do what rvm's gemsets do)

Open Source
-----------

- find an icon
- put on github
- write a blog post
- deploy to public maven repo
